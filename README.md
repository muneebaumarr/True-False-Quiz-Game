# True-False-Quiz-Game
Python quiz game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, built to reinforce core concepts like classes, methods, and loops.

##  Features

- A set of fun True/False questions
- Object-Oriented Programming with custom classes
- Tracks user score
- Displays the correct answer after each question
- Clean, readable output for user feedback
- Total score display at the end

## What I Learned
This was one of my first projects using Object-Oriented Programming. Here's what I practiced:

- How to define and use classes and objects

- How to store multiple objects in a list

- How to separate logic into methods and keep the code clean

- How to loop through objects and manage user interaction

- How to build logic myself without relying too much on tutorials

- This project helped me gain confidence in:

- Writing clean code

- Structuring a small Python application

- Understanding how __init__, methods, and attributes work together
